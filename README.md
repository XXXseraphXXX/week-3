# Week-3 Language Systems & ML
## Language Systems
What is happening in an ide( Integrated Development Environment )?
- Well each group of language display it differently
  - for classical sequence -> C++,C,Fortran
  ide for classical sequence 
  ![ide](idec.JPG)
  
  Another group of language like Java, C# display this
  **Quick note: Java and C# does not have a linker because the program is linked at run time.**

  As for lisp it display it like this

## Part of some IDE
**Compiler** and **Interpreters**
- Compilers takes an entire program language and convert them to low level language like binary code.
- Interpreters directly excutes the high level language.
- **Note: virtual machines can be consider as an interpreter for low level languages as they firectly executes them without first translating them.**
compiler can generate efficient code and run faster thaan interpreted programs
example facebook having to make hhvm.

we have to translate some lanuages to **assembly language**
what is assembly language?
- assembly language is a type of low level programming language that is intended to communicate directly with a computer's hardware.
- design to be readable by use human.
- **Practice example:**

## ML or SML( standard ML)
